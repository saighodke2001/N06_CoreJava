/*Question: Find First and Last Position of an Element In Sorted Array
You have been given a sorted array/list  consisting of  elements. You are also given an integer.
Now, your task is to find the first and last occurrence of ‘K’ in 'ARR'.
1. If ‘K’ is not present in the array, then the first and the last occurrence will be -1. 
2. ARR may contain duplicate elements.

Example 1:
Input :  Array = [0, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6] ,  K = 3
Output : [-1, -1]

Example 2:
Input : Array = [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2], K = 2
Output : [4, 7]*/
